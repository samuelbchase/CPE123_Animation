# CPE123_Animation
This is the final project for Z. Wood's CPE123 class.
It was created by Bonita Galvan, Ben Troller, Samuel Chase, and Audrey Gerughty
A couple of things to note:

This project is currently split up into several sections: the introduction, main flight, and conclusion/reveal portions. Although it currently runs in the "Everything Together" section, the project need quite a bit of work. In order to meet the requirements set in [the rubric](https://polylearn.calpoly.edu/AY_2015-2016/pluginfile.php/249647/mod_resource/content/1/FinalRubric_2015.pdf), we need to clean up the code a significant amount and eliminate a few errors. According to the rubric, we need to:

Meet deadlines, contain a story, include articulated character animation, create an expressive sketch, have the sketch perform as expected, have an interesting look and feel, be origional (with respect to other projects in the class), follow good coding style, and be somewhat complex.

List of things to do:

* Make city look nicer/3d
* Make crane follow mouseY
* Don't let credits overlap with parents at end
* Add text prompts
* Make crane flip if clicked
* Make cat's eyes move
* Add music
* Change grass (again?)
* Make all iterations of the crane flying use the newer method
